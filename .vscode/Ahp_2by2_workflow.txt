1 Pre-requisities (INPUTS)
1.1. Criteria List
    Possible scenarios
    - Exp_Admin has fixed the criteria + other (pruning)
    - Exp_Admin has fixed all criter (full)
    - Exp_Admin has allowed user to choose and even extend =
        Subject can choose a sub-set of existing criteria in the database
        AND also add their own new criteria (e.g. Custom Bloatware, Easy of Rooting)
        [FOR NOW JUST CREATE A PLACEHOLDER IF CONDITION TO SEE IF EMPTY]
        e.g. [Price, OS, Screen]
1.2. Alternatives List
    - Exp_Admin pre-defined set of phones
    - User selects from catalog
    [Samsung, QMobile, Huawei] no = j
2. Initialize Level_0 comparison matrix (criteria comparisons)
e.g. Level_0_matrix = [ [1,1,1], //price
                        [1,1,1], //os
                        [1,1,1]  //screen
                       ]
3. Generate initial "Level_0_Weights" e.g. = [0.333, 0.333, 0.333] (1/n = equally distributed across number of alternatives)

4. Initialize Level_1 dictionary of comparison matrices
e.g. Level_1_compDict = {
                            criteria_list[0]: [...jxj Matrix...]
                            criteria_list[1]: ...jxj Matrix
                            ...
                            criteria_list[n]: [...jxj Matrix...]
                        }

5. Display table of alternatives and criteria list in 2 by 2 format
[TODO: test a 2x2 comparison matrix ranking against 3x3 but with 3rd options 0,
is it same or do we have different results]

5.1 FOR CRITERIA COMPARISONs explore 2 visualization options:
 a. Constantly show a ranking graph for the criteria (initialized at all are equal);
 but give an option to change with a button on/close to/undedr the graph
 b. Hideable div, with show/hide option under/near the heading "Criteria", labelled "Show Weights"
RESULT: an uptodate weights matrix for criteria
e.g. Level_0_matrix = [ [1,2,2], //price
                        [0.5,1,2], //os
                        [0.5,0.5,1]  //screen
                       ]
5.2 DISPLAY OVERALL PHONE RANKING CHART based on uptodate comparison matrices

6 USER/SUBJECT goes through each pair of phones, and goes through slide bars for each
criteria, and chart updates based on recalculation of dictionary of matrices.

7. before User can leave the page, prompt if there are incomplete rankings
