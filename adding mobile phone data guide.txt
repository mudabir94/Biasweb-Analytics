While creating csv file you can add the image path to fields such as imagepath1, sideimage1,sideimage2 etc. 
path example : 
" webapp/img/frontDisplay/appleiphonexr.jpg  
"
imagepath1 is used for front display or catalog image. 

Once your DB is set you have to do couple of things in the FrontEnd. 

Add code in templates/sidebartemplates/createExpSideBars/crtExpsidebartemp_exp.html 

Paste this code from the template
             <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-md-6">
                      <p>Apple</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="col-md-6">
                     <input type="checkbox" name="Apple_check" value="Apple" onchange="brandCheck_box(this)" >
                  </div>
             </div>

Change the name of brand with the new brand name you added. In this case remove Apple and replace it with new one. 



-Then go to templates/crudexperiment/create_experiment.html 
- search for listoftotalbrands and add the new brand name in the list as well. Its case sensitive so add the exact name 
as you did in the db.
