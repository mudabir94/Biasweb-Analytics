DUE BY WED 07/11 3pm Meeting (make invite)
THESE ARE BEYOND SYNCHRONIZATION OF THINGS ALREADY ON shaz BRANCH that need to be accomodated in mudabir branch.

12. ***PRIORITY *** Able to replace subject data (even in database after import) by simply importing
new XL file (linked TODO: implement import of XL file)

1. DONE! CONTINUE PREVIOUS DESIGN SESSION:
*(done)a. Pre-populate features to enable input checkboxes, if user wishes 
to continue with previous design session.
*(done )b. import subjects (UNPICKLE) after javascript prompt. 

(BACK-END COMPLETE, FRONT-END VERIFICATION TODO)
2. IF FEATURES NOT SELECTED: need to set defaults (TODO: Shazib needs to define these and
Mudabir will implement) 
2.1 Should inform as a footnote to blocks table. What will be default settings for non selected features. 
2.2 Give option to change these default unmeasured features. for e.g an extra column in feature level div.

3. ENSURE 3 SCENARIOS FOR BATCH MANAGEMENT ARE CORRECTLY HANDLED:
*(Done)i. None --> Should ask if want's self-defined: if not then simply run splitInBins with 1 and give default batch name 'BATCH' and show summary with Batch = 1 and Total = total of batch 1.  ALso, should NOT show this as column on subject data table.
*(done)ii. PRE-DEFINED: ok, no need for futher improvments, EXCEPT highlight the column that has been named as batch title and show 'Batch Title' UNDER its header.
*(Done)iii. SELF-DEFINED. ok, but ADD column to subjData (before pickling) AND show in its title the chosen Batch name (TODO: make sure that number of batches leads to change in default batch label numbers, e.g. 1 ===> 1; 2 ===> 1,2 - should only show the labels div after selection of batch numbers)
[LINKED TO #12 - REFRESH DIVS AND DELETE SUBJECTS TO BE DONE]

4.. (NOT PRIORITY) IMPLEMENT APPEND SUBJECTS (AT LEAST ALLOW REPLACEMENT OF EXISTING SUBJECT SET, coupled with the table formatting changes suggested later in this list)

5. IF PREVIOUS SESSION EXISTS, GIVE OPTION TO DISCARD OR SAVE WHERE IT WAS, AND THEN START A NEW SESSION:
5.1- [DONE] at Refresh button/after back button.
5.2- [partially done]When exiting the "Create/Exit Experiment" use case, should simply clear the session, must have saved experiment already before that.

6. [PENDING - LOW PRIORITY] Replace expCont.idField calls with expCont.setCustomIdField()
[TODO: Shazib needs to implement and migrate this change in the Experiment Model - CHECK PULL shaz BEFORE TESTING.

7.[done] Allow Exp Admin to be able to change their mind about how they want batches after seeing the summary
[REFER TO #3 & #12 ABOVE: should be able to switch from one to the other after seeing summary result]

8. Should also be able to change mind about blocks (especially after changing batches in #7, or changing feature levels)
MAYBE ASK AFTER FEATURE CHANGE WHETHER DIRECTLY __RE-ASSIGN ALREADY IMPORTED SUBJECTS TO NEW BLOCKS__.

*(done)9. Adding dynamic column TO EXISTING BLOCKS TABLE (tab_blocks) rather than in separate div

10. TABLE FORMATTING wishlist: 
10.1 Ability to filter on block, on batch, by name/rollno, etc. + SORTING
10.2 Ability to search for specific records/emails
10.3** Add block 'fine-tuning', e.g. re-assign records assigned to Block X to Block Y, or from Batch A to Batch B.
10.4 Highlight batch field, and have mapped fields appear in small print under their title (e.g. 'SECTION'...Batch Field - under it in smaller font)
10.5 Update batch/block column AFTER changes (use dynamic column addition - no need for separate input and output subjects data)
10.6 Single Entry.

*(done)11. Find why last record is pop from subject data.
