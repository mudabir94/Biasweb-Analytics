1. MobilePhones
2. PhoneCriteria
3. ExpCriteriaOrders


These three models circle around info of criteria. 

PhoneCriteria and ExpCriteriaOrder have (<< one to many relationship>>)
ExpCriteriaOrder uses PhoneCriteria key as a foriegn key. Which tells us that Whatever criteria name we'll set in 
PhoneCrtieria will be used by ExpCriteriaOrder.

But there is a major issue here. 

MobilePhones Model has criteria names which are set when we created this Model.
E.g 
Price
Memory
Ram
Cpu
Gpu 
battery

When we have to add any thing to PhoneCriteria we have see MobilePhones Model. 
We can add a criteria name of our own. 
E.g 
User Add a criteria "Battery" but in MobilePhones it is "battery". 
So it'll cost us a major conflict in our design workflow...
