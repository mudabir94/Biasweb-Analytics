PART 1: DECIDE THE CRITERIA TO SHOW THE SUBJECT
[THIS ASSUMES @MUDABIR HAS COMPLETED THE LINKING OF SORT_FEATURES TABLE TO THE CURRENT SET OF PHONE FEATURES]
1.1 The main feature that controls this is "Criteria Display Mehtod"
1.2 When unselected, this means the exp.admin wants to show "FULL" criteria (C.full)
--->1.2.1 So, if it is not ticked, then we must prompt the exp.admin to "OK" the full DEFAULT list
--------> 1.2.1.a: Create a Model (Table) "PhoneCriteria" to store the current fields of Mobilephones table (dynamically - should
refresh every time the admin logs in). It will have an extra column/field called "Default", which is 0 or 1 (or 2 
for obligatory?) depending on admin choice
(initially, we will set it for the admin)
---------> 1.2.1.b: The PhoneCriteria model will also track if certain fields are mandatory (Mandatory)
---------> 1.2.1.c: PLEASE NOTE, THIS DEFAULT FULL CRITERIA SET WILL BE saved in ExpCriteriaOrder BUT WILL __NOT___ APPEAR IN BLOCKS AS A FEATURE LEVEL (REMAINS UNTICKED)
--->1.2.2 The admin at this point can unselect from the default offered criteria.
--->1.2.3 Save admin choice in a table called ExpCriteriaSet [Exp, Block (null=true), FvP, CO-pos, Cr-Name ]

1.3 When selected, then again, admin is asked for FULL first (same as in 1.2),
but only diff is THERE WILL BE BLOCK ID which tells us that there is also a PRUNE OPTION in the same Experiment.

1.4 PRUNING - This will start like 1.2, but offer the C.FULL defined for that specific EXPERIMENT in 1.3

IN ALL THESE CASES, FULL WILL DICTATE THE ORDERING.

PART 2: RECONCILIATION WITH CRITERIA:

Simply put, WITHIN a C.full condition, the ordering can be changed.

C.full-Co.F.1
c.full-co.F.2
C.prune - Co.P.1
c.prune - co.p.2
[BY DEFAULT, THE ORDERING VERSIONS OF FULL WILL CARRY TO PRUNE AS P.1 AND P.2, UNLESS ADMIN CHANGES IT]

NOTE: If a default criteria set is used (Criteria Display Method is OFF), then instead of CO.F.1, simply save as "default".  This should not be included as a "Feature Level" in any blocks of the experiment.
