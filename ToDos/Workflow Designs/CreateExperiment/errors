ERRORS TO BE SOLVED.
Server Side Errors..
1. If Criteria Assigning process is not complete, and if we click manage batch tab. Upload file and try to process it'll
 fail from the server side.. 
 Reason:: Its a problem to pickle, As New Experiment is created but then its not found in the pickle, when used again in 
 code. 
2. Similary, before completing "Criteria Assigning Process and Batch Creation process" if we press assign to block, it 
should not create new experiment.
