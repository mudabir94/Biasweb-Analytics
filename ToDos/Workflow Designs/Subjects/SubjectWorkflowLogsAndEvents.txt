Workflow- Subject workflow will circle around the follwing checks. 

- Checks to be considered
1	Interactivity	                I | I.0 | I.1 |
2	Revisiablity	                R	| R.0 | R.1 |  R.2|
3	Weight Generation Method	    W	| W.direct |  W.AHP  |  W.direct |
4	Alternatives Display Method	  A	| A.all | A.1by1 | A.2by2 | A.user |
5	Criteria Display Method	      C	| C.full | C.pruned | Cdm.Def |
6	Phone Set	                    P	| P.0  | P.1 | P.All | P.Default |
7	Criteria Ordering             CO| CO.1 | C0.2 | CO.Def |


This workflow will be explained by going through different cases. 
It will cover from the start, when the Subject logs in till he/she finishes the experiment. 

In all cases User role is Subject.
These steps will be same for every user. 
1. User logs in.
    - User Redirected to Home.html page. It'll go to Home Function in Views.py
2. Users role and then its active experiment id is seen. 
3. Home.html is rendered, relevant data is passed and now the user can see the home page
   showing  user, the active experiment he is in, and two links are shown 
   -Mobile Catalog 
   -Show Filter(Not linked- half implemented)
4. User presses Mobile Catalog link. mobileCatalog_pageLoader() is called which is defined in (sidebartemp_subject.html). 
5. In mobile.html user is only shown those Mobile Phones that are set by the admin. 
    They can be default, P.All or P.1 or P.2
6. mobile_phone_view loads the mobile.html page without seeing any Feature Check (which is P.) here. 
7. Mobile.html on document.load sends an ajax request to get_mobile_data (getMobiledata in Views.py) 
    In this Function- 
    2 Main things are done. 
    1. Phonset Feature is checked through "exp_feat_levels".
    2. Page visited Log is saved in (storeuserpagelogs).
8. Based on the PhoneSet Features Mobile Phones are extracted and are send back to the mobile.html page. 
9. The Mobiles can now be seen by the user. 
10. Now, User is shown the mobile phones catalog. 
11. For testing Purposes user has to select atleast and atmost 3 phones for comparison (For Now!!).
12. Once the user selects the phones, comparison button appears. 
13. On clicking the comparison button. myFunc (name is to changed) in mobile.html is called. 
14. It gets the MobilePhones -id that are selected by user and sends an ajax Request to showMob Function in Views.py 
15. showMob functionality is written in comments above the function name. 
16. After Recieving exp_feat_levels, Weight Generation Method is checked. 

Case 1- Subject id -- 16010087
 -> Exp No -134
 -> Feature Set by Admin --> ['I.1', 'R.1', 'W.direct', 'C.pruned']
 -> Feature that are Default --> ['A.1by1','P.All']

 17. In this case Weight Generation Method is W.direct so it'll redirect to "criteria_weights" (criteriaWeights  in Views.py). 
 18. criteriaWeights main functionality in views.py. 
 19. As we're assuming its the first time it'll store page in visited logs(storeuserpagelogs) list.
 20. Check Revisiablity,Weight Generation Method,Alternatives Display Method, and will load the page. 
 21. Once the user sets the criteria weights he'll press the save button and an ajax POST method request will be made. 
 22. This will save everything in the memory. As seen in the function.
 -- It can be seen that  W.direct, C.pruned, P.All have been implemented. 
 23. User Presses Next Button. Here Alternatives Display Method is checked. As it is A.1by1
    it'll redirect to comparemobile_1by1_direct page. (compareMobileOneByOneDirect) function in views.. 
 24. On loading this page, we'll get the Interactivity and Revisiablity features. Due to which 
    we'll switch on and off the buttons and graphs.
 25. In Our Case both Revisiablity and Interactivity is on. So the User can see the graphs and can go
    back and forth.
 26. This Revisiabilty check will be on each page from mobile.html to comparemobile_1by1_direct. 
 27. We will constantly check if the user has permission to see the page again. 
 28. The check to see if the user has already visited the page is stored in storeuserpagelogs. 
 -- This includes all of the workflow and some of the events that are directly linked with the workflow..
 -- Special Events that are performed in  comparemobile_1by1_direct,criteriaWeights... 
   -->comparemobile_1by1_direct
   1. <<MakeTable and Rslider (Main Population of page, through these functions.)>>
    - In ajax POST Method's success function, makeTable function(which is used to make Comparison Table)
    - rSlider function is called, Whose onChange function will run recursively untill all the 
    sliders and loaded. (whenever the table is made this onChange Function will run on its own)
    - Later when the user will change the slider, onChange function will run, which will store the logs
    and perform other calculations that required. 
    - It'll also change the Values of Bar and Pie charts. As everything is linked. 
    - When ((--show_FinalChart(), showchart_criteria()--))  are about to run Interactivity will be checked if false we'll not show the chart  
    - In our case Interactivity is on so we'll these functions.
   2. <<Pressing Next Button>>
    -will run nextMobile() function, that will first store logs about pressing 
      Next or Prev button (storenextprevbuttonlogs).
    - it'll load the next mobile in Dictionary... 
   3. <<Bar and Pie charts>>
    - ((--show_FinalChart(), showchart_criteria()--)) both contains a Function Chart() which is also 
   a plug in like rSlider. 
    - Chart Function has certain call back options that allow us to store information if user
     hovered over the charts. 
   

Case 2- Subject id -- 16010057
-> Exp No -134
-> Feature Set by Admin --> ['I.1', 'R.1', 'W.AHP', 'C.pruned']
-> Feature that are Default --> ['A.2by2','P.All']

  17. In this case Weight Generation Method is W.AHP so it'll redirect to "comparemobilespecsfilt_ver" (compareMobileSpecsFilterVer in Views.py). 
  18. "2by2comapremobilespecsfiltver.html" will be loaded.
  19. On Page Load Ajax POST Method call is made and it'll go to "compareMobileSpecsFilterVer" POST Check in Views. 
  20. Now We retrieve Interactivity and Revisiabilty set for this case. Which is I.1 and R.1.
  Note-- This work should have been done in get function but for now its fine. (We can change it in future)
  21. Criteria list is made seeing Criteria Display Method which in our case is C.Pruned.
  22. After getting these details from views.py in success function of ajax
     it'll start to make table and graphs. 
  23. Interactivity checks and Revisiablity checks are implemented. 
  24. All checks--> I,R, W.AHP, C.Pruned, P.All and A.2by2 all implented.. 
  25. Bar, pie alternate_criteria range slider, next prev btns, criteria Weights logs are implemented.
  26. Data is stored in json format. 
  27. SubmitData() func will get all these logs and other score lists and send an ajax request to save. (Not Done).. 
  28. Survey Form added.
  29. Page visit logs are also save but temporarily.
