PRE-REQUISITES

1. Experiments should be saved with status levels as defined in controller.py

STATUS DESCRIPTIONS

--> SUBJECTS CAN LOGIN
 10. OPEN = 'OPEN' #READY + login shared w/ Subjects
 11. ACTIVE = 'ACTIVE' #Subject(s) are undergoing experiment

--> SUBJECTS CANNOT LOGIN ( < 10 )
0. DESIGN_MODE = 'DESIGN_MODE' #Under Construction
1. UNASSIGNED = 'UNASSIGNED' #Design/BLock structure complete - No Subjects Assigned yet
2. READY = 'READY' #Design complete + Subjects List Assigned
3. CLOSED = 'CLOSED' #No longer accepting Subjects - awaiting analysis
4. SUSPENDED = 'SUSPENDED' #Not accepting Subjects - could be reopened - some design changes allowed
5. CANCELLED = 'CANCELLED' #Abandoned - not accepting subjects ever
6. ANALYZED = 'ANALYZED' #Analysis Reports generated after CLOSED 

NOT IN controller [TODO] 

7. HOLD = 'HOLD' #Admin temporarily closes experiment (non design issue - coordinating multiple experiments)

WORKFLOW

User logs in and is first evaluated to see if they are "Subject" role.
If TRUE:
    1. Need to determine which Experiment to log the subject into
    --> Possibilities:
        1.a. Subject has only one Active experiment at a time
            --> Proceed to only Active Experiment
        1.b. Subject has multiple Active experiments
            --> Give subject a menu/list to select the experiment they 
            want to go to

EVENTUALLY - LOGIN TO THE ACTIVE EXPERIMENT
    2. Retrieve feature list of the active experiment
     
        2.1 P --> Phone set offered (pre-selected [p.default, p.1, p.2] vs. user-selected [p.0])
        2.2 C --> Initially, top 2/3 to show if p.0 is on.
              --> Criteria Display
              --> Criteria Ordering
