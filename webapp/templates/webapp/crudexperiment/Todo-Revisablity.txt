    Question numbers

Criteria Display Vs Criteria range
1. Change current Criteria Display platform feature lable to "Criteria Range"
2. Implement a separate Criteria Display feature in the Platform/Experiment Feature Model
--> a. CD.1by1
--> b. CD.2by2 (for AHP only)
--> c. CD.all 

3. CD.all: Either go for a vertical bars implementation (like Volume Mixer)
or Go for array of Icons/Compressed List (Acts like a map for navigation)
and shows currently active comparisons in a larger size (to know what is current question)
