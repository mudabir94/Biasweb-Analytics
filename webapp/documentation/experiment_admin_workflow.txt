Experiment_admin has one major task, To create an experiment structure which can be divided in parts.
The Experiment structure is comprised of following things. 
1. Select Biasing Features to test
    Biasing Features are comprised of 
    1.1 Interactivty
    1.2 Revisiability
    1.3 AHP 
    1.4 Sequence
2. Define Subject Groups. 
    - First the Subjects are enrolled for the Specific Experiment. 
    - How Subjects are enrolled. 
        - Each experiment can have multiple batches.
            -Batch means a group that has multiple subjects in it. 
            -Batch Table 
            * id  Experiment_id  Subject_id 
            * 
            *
        - Each Batch can have multiple blocks.
        - Each Subject is assigned to the Batches.  
        - How are the batches created(Number of batches)??? 
            - A block contains persmissions that are assigned to the subjects.
                -Permission are basically a set of features that are allowed for the subjects.
                - Example
                 * blockid   interactivity   Revisiability  AHP  Sequence       
                 *   1           0              0           1      1
                 *   2           1              1           0      0 
                 *  ...
                - This table is created on the bases of the number of features an 
                  experiment admin wants to conduct an experiment on. 
                    - If The Experiment_admin selects 2 features for testing then a 2 by 2 
                      matrix is created. This matrix will contain total of four different combination. 
                - After Creation of the block it is up to the Experiment_admin to decide of 
                  how he wants to assign each permission/row/id/combination/blockid/blockNumber 
                  to the subject. 
                  - He can randomly assign the blocks to the subjects. 
                  - It is upto him.    
            - Each Subject can have only one block permission/row/id/combination/blockid/blockNumber
              but different subjects can have same
              block permission/row/id/combination/blockid/blockNumber.
            - So each Subject is assigned a permission/row/id/combination/blockid/blockNumber
            - A final table of Experiment is created having the following items.
            *  id   Experiment_id  Batch_id  Block_id  Subject_id 
            *  
            *
            *
            *
3. On the Basis of the final table the experiment would be conducted.
