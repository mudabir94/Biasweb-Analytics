-Workflow of Subjects based on experiment features (Chosen levels and Default Levels)

1- Subject logs in. Redirected to Home view. 
    - First Check- See in how many subjects the subject is enrolled and which exp is active for him.
    - Using that exp id we'll get all the experiemt feature (chosen levels and default levels.)
    - Check which chosen levels are not blank against the exp_feature. 
    - Get subject blocks list. 
    - Use the Chosen levels list and the blocklevel list to find the matching level. 
    - and store it in feature level list. 
    - Merge feature level list with the default level list. 
    - Then we'll have one feature level list containing the all the levels set by admin for the subject.
